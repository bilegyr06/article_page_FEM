## My process
I began the project by carefully analyzing the design and requirements, then structured the HTML with semantic elements to ensure accessibility and clarity. Adopting a mobile-first approach, I wrote the initial CSS to create a responsive layout using Flexbox and CSS custom properties, gradually enhancing the design for larger screens with media queries. I implemented the interactive share functionality using JavaScript, dynamically inserting and removing elements based on user actions and screen size. To manage state and transitions between mobile and desktop views, I utilized CSS variables and event listeners that respond to window resizing. Throughout the process, I tested the component on different devices and browsers to ensure consistent appearance and behavior. Finally, I refined the codebase for readability and maintainability, making sure the solution met all challenge requirements.
